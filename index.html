                        Certified Technician with over two years of experience currently going to school to gain
                        more engineering knowledge. Before i found my talent as a Technician i was a Mechanic.
                        Every sunny day i wasn't working was most likely spent in the garage working on my ride. I'm not
                        gunna lie i did get frusterated
                        at some points, but no matter how difficult it got nothing took away the satisfaction of fixing
                        the
                        code at the end of the day.
                        I like to test my work at Sanoma Raceway to drag race. Before my drag racing days i did a lot of
                        photography. People admired my photos
                        and asked to do photoshoots of them with their race cars. When i'm not racing or at school i'm
                        most
                        likely taking
                        a walk with my dogs. My first job was with Pep Boys in Commercial Sales. I was able to use my
                        car
                        knowledge and apply them at work, but as a female i found out quickly
                        that my knowledge was questioned. After a while i got annoyed of peoples opinion and figured i
                        need
                        to change my field to
                        something where my knowledge wouldn't be questioned and valued regardless of the sex. I joined a
                        nine month program at Unitek College
                        and went over Hardware, Software, Networking, Security, Vlan, Server, Cloud and Desk Support. I
                        graduated with a Certification of
                        Completion in Information Technology. That helped me get my foot into Google through a vendor
                        company. After a year of being with
                        Google I learned that a lot of big companies like Facebook and Google hire most of their workers
                        through vendor companies which are highly underpaid
                        compared to white badge Google Employees.
                        I found it hard as a vendor to be able to grow in the company, so i was motivated to go back to
                        school so i can be able to apply to any engineering position.
                        My goal after this boot camp is to apply back to Google and become a white badge employee. So
                        far in
                        this boot camp i've learned
                        soo much and can't wait to master the art and become a professional developer.
